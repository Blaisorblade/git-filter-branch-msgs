filter-branch-msgs
==================

Update mentions of hashes in commits messages â€” for filter-branch.

Goal
----

Many commit messages mention other commits by hash. However, when using `git-filter-branch`, all hashes are changed completely, so such references are broken.*

Warning: I wrote this in an afternoon, and it's been tested only lightly. Plus, `git-filter-branch` is a dangerous beast anyway, so you're supposed to know what you're doing.

Installation/usage instruction
------------------------

I think what's below should be sufficient, but 

1. Install [nailgun 0.9.1](http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/). You'll just need the C client, not the Java part.
2. `ln -s $(which ng) ~/bin/git-filter-branch-msgs`
3. Run `sbt stage` in this directory. This requires [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) 0.13 or later.
4. Run the server with ./target/universal/stage/bin/filter-branch-msgs
5. Now you can use it with git-filter-branch.

    The intended usage pattern is through

  ```
  git-filter-branch
    --date-order \
    --msg-filter 'git-filter-branch-msgs' $your_other_filters_here
  ```

6. Kill the server with Ctrl-C.
7. The server will create a log, named `echo-translate.log`, wherever the client (`git-filter-branch-msgs`) is run.

It should be possible in theory to use this program without nailgun, but that will start a JVM for each commit, so it is not recommended for any non-trivial project.
Plus, I don't provide complete docs for it (you need to change `mainClass` in `build.sbt` to `filterbranch.EchoTranslate` and redo `sbt stage`, then you'll need git to use the produced script). I could do it if there's interest.
